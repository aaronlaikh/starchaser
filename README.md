# starchaser

Setting up a website for a group of artists (aeror404, yuukou__).  The portfolio website is intended for us to post intended appearances at conventions, samples and links to our work, and shop/contact information.  The site, though intended to be a simple art or design portfolio site, is jointly designed and worked on indepently by myself and yuukou__ to gain practice using visual view-based frameworks such as React.

As of 2020 work on the site was put on hold as appearances at events have been cancelled and focus has been shifted towards other projects.
